Other taxes, such as Council Tax or VAT, do not count for this purpose. The charity will reclaim 25p of tax for every £1 you donate. You can cancel this declaration at any time by contacting us. Please remember that it is your responsibility to notify us if there are any changes to your tax status, name or address.
